# Assignment Lab in Groups
1. You will be assigned to work in your groups on this week's assignments. 
2. In those groups, begin to understand the requirements document for the project, which is a standard version of the document you constructed in your last assignment. 
3. Sit in your assigned group area. You can move around when you find each other. Your groups are in Canvas for FERPA reasons.
